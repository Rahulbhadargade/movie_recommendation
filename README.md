# movie_recommendation
This is the mini project movie recommendation, Gives you simple recommendation. Develop a machine learning-based movie recommendation system that can predict and suggest movies to users based on their viewing history and preferences. The system should efficiently analyze user ratings and movie attributes to provide personalized movie recommendations,
